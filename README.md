## Requirements

### Node.js

Please install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) `>= v22` and [npm](https://nodejs.org/) `>= v11`. You will find it
easier to use the Node Version Manager [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

To use the correct version of Node.js for this application, via nvm:

```bash
cd apha-integration-bridge
nvm use
```

## Local development

In-order to run this application locally, you will need to register and obtain a login token for the Oracle Container Registry.

You can find the instructions on how to do this in the [Oracle Container Registry documentation](https://container-registry.oracle.com/).

Once you have obtained your personal access token, you can log in to the Oracle Container Registry by running `docker login container-registry.oracle.com` and providing your email address as the username and your personal access token as the password.

Test your login by pulling the OracleDB image:

```bash
docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/free:latest
```

### Environment variables

In local development, we follow NextJS convention of using a `.env.local` file to store environment variables. All necessary defaults are provided inside
the `.env` file.

### Setup

Install application dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

### Development

To run the application in `development` mode run:

Start the local development dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
npm run compose:up
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Testing

In-order to run the tests locally, against testcontainers that run the free version of OracleDB, you will need to install the "OracleDB Instant Client libraries".
You can find the instructions on how to install them in the [OracleDB documentation](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/downloads.html).

Once this is done, create a `.env.test.local` file at the root of the project, with the location of the "OracleDB Instant Client libraries". For example:

```bash
ORACLE_CLIENT_LIB_DIR=/Users/yourusername/Downloads/instantclient_23_3
```

Then you can run the tests with:

````

To test the application run:

```bash
npm t
````

### Production

To mimic the application running in `production` mode locally run:

```bash
npm start
```

### Npm scripts

All available Npm scripts can be seen in [package.json](./package.json).
To view them in your command line run:

```bash
npm run
```

### Update dependencies

To update dependencies use [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates):

> The following script is a good start. Check out all the options on
> the [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates)

```bash
ncu --interactive --format group
```

### Formatting

#### Windows prettier issue

If you are having issues with formatting of line breaks on Windows update your global git config by running:

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

## API endpoints

| Endpoint             | Description                    |
| :------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| `GET: /health`       | Health                         |
| `GET: /example    `  | Example API (remove as needed) |
| `GET: /example/<id>` | Example API (remove as needed) |

## Development helpers

### MongoDB Locks

If you require a write lock for Mongo you can acquire it via `server.locker` or `request.locker`:

```javascript
async function doStuff(server) {
  const lock = await server.locker.lock('unique-resource-name')

  if (!lock) {
    // Lock unavailable
    return
  }

  try {
    // do stuff
  } finally {
    await lock.free()
  }
}
```

Keep it small and atomic.

You may use **using** for the lock resource management.
Note test coverage reports do not like that syntax.

```javascript
async function doStuff(server) {
  await using lock = await server.locker.lock('unique-resource-name')

  if (!lock) {
    // Lock unavailable
    return
  }

  // do stuff

  // lock automatically released
}
```

Helper methods are also available in `/src/helpers/mongo-lock.js`.

### Proxy

We are using forward-proxy which is set up by default. To make use of this: `import { fetch } from 'undici'` then
because of the `setGlobalDispatcher(new ProxyAgent(proxyUrl))` calls will use the ProxyAgent Dispatcher

If you are not using Wreck, Axios or Undici or a similar http that uses `Request`. Then you may have to provide the
proxy dispatcher:

To add the dispatcher to your own client:

```javascript
import { ProxyAgent } from 'undici'

return await fetch(url, {
  dispatcher: new ProxyAgent({
    uri: proxyUrl,
    keepAliveTimeout: 10,
    keepAliveMaxTimeout: 10
  })
})
```

## Docker

### Development image

Build:

```bash
docker build --target development --no-cache --tag apha-integration-bridge:development .
```

Run:

```bash
docker run -e PORT=3001 -p 3001:3001 apha-integration-bridge:development
```

### Production image

Build:

```bash
docker build --no-cache --tag apha-integration-bridge .
```

Run:

```bash
docker run -e PORT=3001 -p 3001:3001 apha-integration-bridge
```

### Docker Compose

A local environment with:

- Localstack for AWS services (S3, SQS)
- Redis
- MongoDB
- This service.
- A commented out frontend example.

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

### Dependabot

We have added an example dependabot configuration file to the repository. You can enable it by renaming
the [.github/example.dependabot.yml](.github/example.dependabot.yml) to `.github/dependabot.yml`

### SonarCloud

Instructions for setting up SonarCloud can be found in [sonar-project.properties](./sonar-project.properties)
